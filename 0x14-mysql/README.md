# Overview #

The ** 0x14. MySQL ** project is a follow up project of the
web server project, for this project we are to add a mysql server
to the web infrastructure we already have on ground.
objectives are to understand the following:
- What is the main role of a database
- What is a database replica
- What is the purpose of a database replica
- Why database backups need to be stored in different physical locations
- What operation should you regularly perform to make sure that your database backup strategy actually works
