# Overview #

The ** 0x1A. Application server ** project
Our web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that was
installed in the first web stack project.
While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task 
is usually given to an application server. In this project
it will be added to the infrastructure, plugged to out Nginx and
made to serve our Airbnb clone project.
